# ACTIONABLE IDEAS


### Idea 1 (preferred):

**Hypothesis:** Introducing a performance chart system for cards will enhance user understanding of card trends, leading to more informed decision-making and improved project management.

**Expected Impact:** Users will be able to identify patterns, track progress, and make data-driven decisions, resulting in improved project efficiency and task management.

**Feature Explanation:** The system will generate charts, such as line charts or bar charts, displaying key metrics like status changes, priority changes, and task completion rates over time. Users can customize the time range and filter cards based on different criteria for more focused insights.

#### Potential Chart Metrics:
1. **Status Changes Over Time:** Visualizing the frequency and distribution of status changes for each card.
2. **Priority Changes Over Time:** Tracking shifts in card priorities over different periods.
3. **Task Completion Rates:** Displaying the percentage of completed tasks over time.

### Usefulness for Customers:
1. **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Users can make informed decisions based on historical trends and patterns.
2. **Project Efficiency:** Visualizing card performance helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing workflows.
3. **Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor the progress of individual cards and overall project timelines.
4. **Collaborative Insights:** Teams can collectively analyze charts to enhance collaboration and decision-making.
